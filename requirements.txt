# 📌 SEC 10-K Downloader – Required Python Packages
# 
# This tool automatically downloads the LATEST 10-K financial filings 
# and Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) reports from the U.S. SEC.
#
# ✅ It can process up to 40 companies at a time 
# ✅ It extracts the 10-K report and removes unnecessary exhibits.
# ✅ Saves reports in both .txt (raw text) and .html (formatted) for easy reading.

# 🔴 IMPORTANT: You MUST update the script with your email address!
# The SEC requires a valid email in API requests.  
# Open sec_downloader.py and update this line with your own email:
#
# headers = {
#     'User-Agent': 'Company Research Tool (your-email@example.com)',
#     'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate'
# }
#
# If you do not update your email, you may be blocked from accessing SEC data.
#
# 🔴 IMPORTANT: You MUST also update the code to include the tickers you would like to download!
